# Data-Structures | Algorithms | Interview preparation


This repository consists of Data structures, Algorithmic implementations & material for interview preparation, whichever it is that you wish to brush up, simply navigate to the relevant folder and find some exciting, well-documented and tested code for your reference! ðŸ”¥ 

We are planning to increase the languages supported by this project.

- Currently we have people working in C/C++ and Java. We need more people with skills in Rust, JS or even Assembly ðŸ˜‰  
If you can code, you can contribute.

## Where to start if you wish to contribute? 
- Look around in the DataStructures directory and check out the template that we follow, it's basically - **First pseudocode** and **Then actual Code**, so that anyone venturing here can understand what the heck is going on in the code, nothing here is intended to be cryptic , every single line of code has been commented well enough, and if you are able to find a bug, please don't hesitate to raise an Issue.

### If you have made up your mind that you certainly wish to contribute-

1. Find something in a language that suits you.
2. Fork the project.
3. Clone.
4. Create a branch.
5. Make your additions/changes.
6. Commit & push your changes.
7. Create a pull request.

We will review it the first time and if needed, add some comments. It is hard to follow rules but in order to become understandable & easy, they must be followed.

Once you are a part of the contributors, any code that is pushed by any member, will have to be reviewed by you or the assigned reviewers 
*(Just a general protocol we follow so that the repo doesn't have any buggy code).* 

Currently we have the following contributing members -
- Ajay Rajan          (Software Engineer - Embedded)                      ajaycrajan@gmail.com
